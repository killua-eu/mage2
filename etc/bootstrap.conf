# Profiles define make.conf defaults and slight differences to the boostrapping process (i.e.
# setting diffrerent package sets, global useflags, make.conf defaults, etc.). 
# Three types of profiles are expected:
# - system profiles (you must select exactly one profile + the @common profile)
# - hardware profiles (you can select exactly one profile)
# - aplication profiles (you can select any number of profiles, but beware that no checks are currently applied to detect/resolve conflicts)
# The system profiles eselect the gentoo portage profiles, so exactly one must me set. The hardware profile may or may not be required. 
# App profiles are just package installation and configuration recipes for your convenience. Enabled profiles will be listed in 
# /etc/mage/profiles-enabled. Also see the /profiles directory in https://github.com/Vaizard/Mage.
# NOTE that the order **is important**, list system profiles first, then hardware profiles, then app profiles. Otherwise you can get quite a mess.

# Mage bootstrap will configure your make.conf automatically to sane defaults with respect
# to the selected BOOTSTRAP_PROFILE and your hardware. Nontheless, some configuration options
# are exported here for your editing pleasure. See also
